## Itzik Ben-Gan, T-SQL Fundamentals 4th Edition

### Notes
#### Pep-talk
- Transact SQL - Microsoft SQL Server Dialect [Checkout my attemp to create an SQL engine](https://github.com/mkavalamanalytics/clone-implementations/tree/main/sqllite)
- Download SQL Server Developer Edition and try it out!
- T-SQL is a way of thinking! And is more than a programming language.
- T-SQL simplicity is not to be confused with the complexity that it hides elegantly.
- Knowing the syntax of T-SQL and writing queries that return the correct output is not the end!
- Relational model is the abstract way of storing data that SQL queries.
- Domains of knowledge as columns and each row represent a relationship between those domains at some time.
- Data is connected not by the way it is stored but by the very values that it stores - key column values.
### Types of statements
- |Data definition |Data manipulation | Data control|
  |------------------|-----------------|--------------|
  |CREATE,ALTER,DROP|SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,MERGE,TRUNCATE|REVOKE,GRANT|
- The book is focussing on Data manipulation set of statements in SQL (DML).
### Set Theory
- A set is any collection M, into a **whole** of **definite, distinct**, objects m of **our perception or thought**<sup>1</sup>.
- An Employee = {name,age,id}
- An attribute = column
  - Attribute is identified by a name not by order.
- Relation = table

  
<sup>1 - A set of students and teachers, Class C, can be a also perceived as set of humans.</sup>
