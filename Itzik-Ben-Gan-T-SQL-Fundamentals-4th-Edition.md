#### Pep-talk
- Transact SQL - Microsoft SQL Server Dialect [Checkout my attemp to create an SQL engine](https://github.com/mkavalamanalytics/clone-implementations/tree/main/sqllite)
- Download SQL Server Developer Edition and try it out!
- T-SQL is a way of thinking! And is more than a programming language.
- T-SQL simplicity is not to be confused with the complexity that it hides elegantly.
- Knowing the syntax of T-SQL and writing queries that return the correct output is not the end!
- Relational model is the abstract way of storing data that SQL queries.
- Domains of knowledge as columns and each row represent a relationship between those domains at some time.
- Data is connected not by the way it is stored but by the very values that it stores - key column values.
